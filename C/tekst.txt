People meeting in secret all over the country to offer a toast to Harry
Vernon and Petunia Dursley with their one-year-old son Dudley were proud to say that they were the most normal people occupying 4 Privet Drive located in the Surrey County town of Little Whinging . Vernon was the director of a drill company called Grunnings while Petunia did housework and looked after Dudley yet she always spent such time craning over garden fence to spy on the neighbours . Despite all this most of the Dursley family were the least people anyone expected to be involved in anything funny or disturbing , for they didn't hold such nonsense in their daily lives . The story begins on 1 November 1981 where many absurd things happened. When all three Dursleys were gossiping happily at breakfast trying to wrestle Dudley in his high chair none of them even noticed a large tawny owl flutter pass their window . It eventually came to Vernon's attention when he was heading to work shortly afterwards and saw a tabby cat reading a map and later a street sign . He attempted to convince himself that these were merely coincidences . Next he saw people in cloaks talking in hushed voices and while he was sitting in his office a stare of owls flew past his window .
